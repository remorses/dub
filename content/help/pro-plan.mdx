Dub has the most generous free tier in the industry.

With the Dub free tier, you can:

- [Create links](how-to-create-link) with [custom domains](how-to-add-custom-domain)
- [Invite teammates](how-to-invite-teammates) to your Dub project
- Leverage advanced link features like device targeting and password protection to create powerful shortlinks

As your usage grows, you may want to upgrade to Dub Pro to unlock more features and benefits.

## Benefits of Dub Pro

By subscribing to Dub Pro unlocks benefits such as more tracked clicks, [root domain redirect](how-to-redirect-root-domain), [custom QR codes](custom-qr-codes), and more.

Here's how Dub Pro compares to the free tier:

## How much does Dub Pro cost?

Dub Pro is priced at $9 per month or $90 per year (2 free months).

As we grow and add more features, we may increase the price of Dub Pro in the future. However, if you subscribe to Dub Pro now, you will be grandfathered into the current price.

## How to upgrade to Pro?

To upgrade to Dub Pro, you first need to [create a project](what-is-a-project#how-to-create-a-project).

Once you have created a project, navigate to your project page and click on the **Upgrade to Pro** button in the top menu bar

This will open up the Upgrade to Pro modal. You can choose to pay monthly or yearly.

Click on the upgrade button and you will be redirected to the payment page.

Once the payment is successful, you will be redirected back to your project page and you will see the Pro badge on the top menu bar.
