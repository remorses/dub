Dub is the only link management tool that allows you to add a custom domain for free. On Dub, you can add as many domains as you want on all plans – including the free plan.

This guide will show you how to add a custom domain to Dub.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need the following:

- A Dub account. If you don't have one, you can [create one for free](https://app.dub.sh/register).
- A domain name. If you don't have one, you can purchase one from any one of the following domain registrars:
  - [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)
  - [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/)
  - [Google Domains](https://domains.google/)
  - [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/)

## Step 1: Add a custom domain

First, [log in](https://app.dub.sh/login) to your Dub account.

### Don't have a project yet?

1. Navigate to the [Dub Dashboard](https://app.dub.sh/) and click on the **Create project** button.
2. Enter the domain you want to use under the "Shortlink domain" input and click **Create project**.

### Already have a project?

If you already have a project and are looking to add another domain to it:

1. Navigate to your project's Domains page – you can do that by clicking on the **Domains** link in the menu bar at the top of your project dashboard.
2. Click on the **Add Domain** button.
3. Enter the domain you want to use and click **Add domain**.

## Step 2: Configure your domain

After adding your domain, you'll be presented with a DNS record that you'll need to add to your domain's DNS settings.

### Adding an apex domain

If you're adding an apex domain (e.g. `example.com`), you'll need to add an `A` record with the following values:

- **Name**: `@` (or leave it blank)
- **Value**: `76.76.21.21`
- **TTL**: `86400` (or the highest value possible)

### Adding a subdomain

If you're adding a subdomain (e.g. `go.example.com`), you'll need to add a `CNAME` record with the following values:

- **Name**: `go` (or whatever subdomain you want to use)
- **Value**: `cname.dub.sh`
- **TTL**: `86400` (or the highest value possible)

## Step 3 (optional): Verify domain ownership

Since we use Vercel as the DNS provider for Dub, you'll need to verify that you own the domain before you can add it to your Dub project.

To do that, you'll need to add a TXT record with the following values:

- **Name**: `_vercel`
- **Value**: `vc-domain-verify=...` (the value will be provided to you on the Dub dashboard)

## How long do I have to wait for my domain to work?

Domain configuration can take anywhere between 1 to 24 hours to complete. If your domain still doesn't work after 24 hours, please [send us an email](mailto:support@dub.sh?subject=Domain%20not%20working) and we'll be happy to help you out.
